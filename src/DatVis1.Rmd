```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr) #to set up options and use kable function
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE) #(echo = TRUE) would include all code

```

# Introduction

Include ***code results***

```{r cars, echo=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```
The `echo = TRUE` parameter was added to the code chunk for printing the R code that has generated the plot.

## Including Plots

Embed plot with a caption for Figure 1.

```{r fig.cap="This is a capture for Figure 1."}
plot(pressure)
```

## Tables
nice looking table
```{r}
myTable <- xtabs(pressure, data = pressure)
kable(myTable, caption = "Table caption.")
```
